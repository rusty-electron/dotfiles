# Description: Pick files and pipe the newline-separated list to another utility
#
# Usage:
#   Copy this file in your $PATH, make it executable and preferably name it to picker.
#   Run commands like:
#     ls -l `picker`
#     cd `picker`
#     vimdiff `picker`
#   or, in fish shell:
#     ls -l (picker)
#     cd (picker)
#     vimdiff (picker)
#
# Note: This use case is limited to picking files, other functionality may not work as expected.
#
# Shell: POSIX compliant
