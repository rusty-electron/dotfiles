I now maintain two linux installations, one on my thinkpad and the other on my dell so one use of this repo is to help sync the configs and another reason is to help the general linux TWM audience in case they happen to need my configs.

#### good-stuff
* look for good bash aliases - `.bashrc`
* my vim and neovim configs - `.vimrc` & `.config/neovim/init.vim`
* my i3 config - `.config/i3/config`
* alacritty yaml file - `.config/alacritty/alacritty.yaml`
